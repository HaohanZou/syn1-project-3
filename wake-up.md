# Welcome to My Blog for Environmental Protection

## Background
* Facts:
    * Nasaâ€™s Goddard Institute announces that average temperature has been warmed by 1 degree Celsius since the industrial revolution, and it is increasing with the speed at 0.2 degree Celsius per decade, causing the rise of sea level, glacial melting and so on.
    * According to reports from MAHB of Stanford University, if human keep the current rate of exploitation and consumption of natural resources, the preliminary energy such as fossil fuel and gas will run out within 30 to 50 years, leading to severe energy depletion, and impeding the further development of our society.
    * . In the 1970s, through experiments, scientists realized the harmful effects to environments from some chemical agents even at very low concentrations such as DDT and CFCs. 
    * in the late 1980s, research had shown that the improving concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses were having significantly negative influences on many aspects.

* Human's reaction:
    * The 3rd phrase of industrial revolution is operating at full speed within many developing countries. 
    * Industries still drain water containing huge amounts of chemical agents into rivers and oceans, disrupting the reproduction of fish and birds and depleting the stratospheric ozone layer. 
    * Human still continue their activities such as intensive exploitation, fossil fuel combustion, and concrete manufacture, emitting toxic gases and forcing people to wear masks for personal health protection. 

* Situation Analysis:


  


## Goal
1. Raise people's awareness by introducing local environmental problems to them.
1. Instead of persuading people to engage in global organizations and initialize international activities, it's much more effective and plausible to appeal people to improve their communities' environments.
