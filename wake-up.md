## Abstract
 
Currently, we are in a position where we have to do something to save our environments. However, with so many existing facts of our deteriorating climate systems, people don't show any signs that they are going to make some changes. In this blog, I will present some analysis on why human don't make any reactions and what kinds of effective strategies we could use to save the Earth.

## Background
* Facts:
    * Nasa’s Goddard Institute announces that average temperature has been warmed by 1 degree Celsius since the industrial revolution, and it is increasing with the speed at 0.2 degree Celsius per decade, causing the rise of sea level, glacial melting and so on.

    * According to reports from MAHB of Stanford University, if human keep the current rate of exploitation and consumption of natural resources, the preliminary energy such as fossil fuel and gas will run out within 30 to 50 years, leading to severe energy depletion, and impeding the further development of our society.

    * . In the 1970s, through experiments, scientists realized the harmful effects to environments and human health from some chemical agents even at very low concentrations such as DDT and CFCs.

    * in the late 1980s, research had shown that the improving concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses were having significantly negative influences on many aspects.

* Public's reaction:
    * The 3rd phrase of industrial revolution is operating at full speed within many developing countries. 
    * Industries still drain water containing huge amounts of chemical agents into rivers and oceans, disrupting the reproduction of fish and birds and depleting the stratospheric ozone layer. 
    * Human still continue their activities such as intensive exploitation, fossil fuel combustion, and concrete manufacture, emitting toxic gases and forcing people to wear masks for personal health protection. 
   

* Situation Analysis:

    * **Finding information**- without an accurate clock under the context of nature, human are out of sync with changes happening in environments.
    * **Expressing information** - scientists’ failure of showing the full-scale picture of climate changes and connecting human activities with this crisis leads to public's overlook of environmental crisis.
    * **Accepting information** - Human’s irrationality of connecting science with personal identities as the main reason that causes the polarization on popular topics such as the environmental crisis.


  

## Goal
In the presentation "Connecting Global Change to Local Impacts & Solutions", Katharine expresses the idea that people care about environments because they are affected by the crisis. As a result, to appeal people's concerns to our climate systems, it's necessary to connect people's value to environmental problems by telling them what kinds of bad effects are taking place within their communities. In this blog, I'm going to use this idea by listing the environmental problems happening in our local area - San Diego. Though it's hardly for me to bring any big impacts on people's thoughts, I hope to improve our local people's awareness and give them several practical strategies to remedy current situations.


## Environemtnal Problems in San Diego

* Due to the continuously increasing of temperature, in the past 50 years, sea level has increased over 4 inches in San Diego Bay.

* Heavy fluctuating significantly affects' human activities which are highly dependent on rain water.

* Beaches in San Diego have been harmfully impacted by the sewage flows from the Tijuana River. The poor water treatment facilities along Tijuana River leads to many trash and sewage imported into ocean.

* Impacts on San Diego area:
    * Environments: 
        
        The large volume amount of trash and sewage have been thrown into oceans and rivers, significantly affect the quality of water and consequently the health and wellbeing of local human and marine animals. What's more, the continuously raising of sea level exacerbate the effects of coastal flooding, leading to severe beach erosion and as well as drainage and rainoff from heavy storms. 

    * Economy:

        Ocean and beaches are one of the most important components of San Diego's economy strucutre. Throught the diversity of marine animals and various recreations, beach in San Diego attracts lots of people to travel at here. However, current environmental crisis affects the biodiversity and environments in bay areas, so tourism has been significantly affected. What's more, as environmental crisis poses so many threats to health of both human and animals, the amount of budget on health care have been increased a lot, making the burden of goverments much heavier.

    * Health:

        Oceans and rivers are the main sources of water supply for San Diego area. However, with so much wastes have been dumped into oceans and rivers, it's inevitable to affects the water that local people daily use. As a result, big threats have been imposed for people's health.

## General Strategies

* For local people, they could cultivate plants in their own gardens or in their communities to improve our environments. With more and more trees and plants, the ability of absorbing water into the ground and the amount of underground water will be significantly benefited. Thus, when rainfall is heavy, the high amount of water can be absorbed into underground and there's no flood in communities. What's more, these plants could help ther reservation of underground water, which can be used as a main source of water supply.

* In addition, we are able to set up an organization to protect the environments of our coast. Since many local people's income relate to tourism and recreation at coast areas, so I believe that many people would attend in this organization. Like "Regional Climate Action Plan" in Florida mentioned by Kahan, we could invite experts to guide our members to use evidence-based methods to address our local coastal environmental problems.
